  <!-- The as gives a name to the expression on the left.
  In general if you are fetching data from the backend
  and you are receiving an observable in return from a service
  in your service layer, it is recommended to pass the data to
  the template using the async pipe, because this has the advantage
  that whenever the component is destroyed the async pipe
  will take care of unsubcribing from the observable.
  This is good to avoid memory leaks. -->
